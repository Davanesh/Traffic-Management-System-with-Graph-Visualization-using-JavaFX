# Traffic Management System 🚦

A Java-based project designed to visualize and manage traffic systems using a graph-based approach. This system uses **JavaFX** for creating interactive visualizations of nodes (intersections) and edges (roads) to depict real-world traffic scenarios effectively.

---

## 🎯 Features
- **Graph Visualization**:
  - Nodes represent intersections.
  - Edges represent roads with weights (e.g., distance or traffic load).
- **Dynamic Interaction**:
  - Add or modify nodes and edges in the traffic graph.
- **Customizable UI**:
  - Visual representation of traffic flow using circles and lines.
  - Color-coded nodes and edges for better understanding.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **JavaFX**: For building the user interface and visualizations.
